continues:

Provide a 'Publish' functionality that immediately makes new menu items visible to customers.

Include a dashboard with analytics showing the most viewed, most purchased, and most liked items by customers.

Provide an interface for making changes to the customer-facing website, such as updating content and layout.

5. Payment Integration
Payments will be handled using Stripe:
Order Placement: When a customer submits an order, the frontend sends the total amount to /api/payment to create a payment intent.

Payment Form: Use Stripe’s JavaScript library to render a payment form (e.g., card input) and process the payment.

Confirmation: On successful payment, confirm the order by saving it to the database and notifying the cashier via WebSocket.

6. Image Upload
Menu item images will be stored in Amazon S3:
Upload Process: When an admin adds or updates a menu item, the frontend sends the image file to the backend.

Backend Handling: Use the AWS SDK for Node.js to upload the image to an S3 bucket and retrieve a public URL.

Database Storage: Save the S3 URL in the image_url field of the Menu_Items table.

7. Authentication
Secure the admin and cashier interfaces:
Login: Implement a login endpoint (e.g., POST /api/login) that accepts username and password, returning a JWT on success.

Route Protection: Use middleware to verify the JWT on protected endpoints (e.g., /api/menu for admin, /api/orders for cashier).

Roles: Check the role field to restrict access (e.g., only "admin" can modify menu items).

8. Implementation Steps
Here’s a step-by-step guide to building the website:
Project Setup:
Initialize a Node.js project (npm init).

Install dependencies: express, mysql2, socket.io, aws-sdk, stripe, jsonwebtoken, etc.

Database Setup:
Set up a MySQL instance (local or cloud-hosted).

Create tables using the schema above.

Backend Development:
Build API endpoints with Express.

Integrate Socket.io for real-time updates.

Add S3 upload logic with the AWS SDK.

Implement Stripe payment intents.

Create comprehensive code documentation with clear comments explaining what each function and component does.

Implement analytics tracking for item views, purchases, and likes.

Frontend Development:
Set up a frontend project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and ease of maintenance.

Build the customer, cashier, and admin interfaces.

Connect to APIs and WebSockets.

Authentication:
Add login functionality and protect routes with JWT.

Testing:
Write unit tests for API endpoints (e.g., using Jest).

Test real-time updates with multiple browser instances.

Use Stripe’s test mode to verify payment flows.

Deployment:
Deploy the backend to a server (e.g., Heroku).

Serve the frontend statically or host separately.

Configure environment variables (e.g., database credentials, Stripe keys).

Monitoring:
Set up logging (e.g., with winston) and monitoring tools.

9. Scalability Considerations
Initial Setup: A single server with MySQL should handle a small restaurant’s traffic.

High Traffic: Add a load balancer and scale the backend horizontally. Optimize the database with indexes or use caching (e.g., Redis) for menu items.

Real-Time: Ensure Socket.io is configured for scalability (e.g., using a Redis adapter for multi-server setups).

10. Security
Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

Hash passwords with a library like bcrypt.

Store sensitive keys (e.g., Stripe secret key, AWS credentials) in environment variables.

Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Conclusion
This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a restaurant website with menu management, online ordering, real-time updates, and payment integration. By using Node.js, MySQL, Socket.io, Stripe, and S3, the site will be functional, scalable, and secure. The frontend will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and ease of maintenance. All code will be thoroughly documented with clear comments explaining functionality to ensure clean, maintainable code that anyone can edit. Start with the project setup and database, then progressively build the backend, frontend, and integrations, testing thoroughly before deployment.
