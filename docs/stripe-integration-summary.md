# Stripe Payment Integration Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented Stripe payment processing for the Baklovah restaurant website. The integration follows a deferred payment capture model, which is ideal for restaurants as it only charges customers when their orders are fulfilled.

   - Payment action buttons for manual capture/processing
   - Detailed payment information in order details modal

3. **Automatic Payment Processing**

   - Payment authorization is automatically cancelled when order status changes to "cancelled"
